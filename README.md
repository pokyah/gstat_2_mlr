# gstat_2_mlr
attempt to implement gstat in mlr (R)

## purpose
This repo is dedicated to my ongoing work of implementing gstat into mlr
* [gstat](https://github.com/edzer/gstat) : Spatial and spatio-temporal geostatistical modelling, prediction and simulation
* [mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr) : Machine Learning in R

## 
The present work follows the guidelines provided by the mlr team under their [integrating another learner tutorial](http://mlr-org.github.io/mlr/articles/tutorial/devel/create_learner.html)

## How to contribute ? 
Please review the code, provide suggestions/comments/enhancements by dropping an issue and/or forking + PR.

## How to test ?
The [sp](https://github.com/edzer/sp) package provides the meuse dataset which is also used as the reference dataset in the gstat manuals and documentation.
This repo therefore also makes use of the meuse dataset

## To-DO
This is an early developement version that has not been extensibely tested. I have pretty much no experience with gstat. If you are familiar with this package, your contributions are more than welcome.

* actually not useful anymore since gstat can also perform autofitting of vg https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2016/02/14/gstat-variogram-fitting.html
